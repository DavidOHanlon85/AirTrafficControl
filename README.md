<h1>Aircraft Control System</h1>

The specifcation required the creation of an Aircraft Control Application that would support several specific 'Aircraft' including 'Airline' (which I would be responsible for), 'Helicopter', 'Glider', 'Drone' etc.

Each aircraft would have shared instance variables and methods with aircraft as well as specific instance variables and methods for their own type.

This OOP solution required the use of inheritance, ENUMs as well as full JUnit testing.

A driver class AircraftControl would also be required to facilite user searches - using parameterised methods.
